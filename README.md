dotfiles.git
============
This is a repository for all the configuration files found in my Linux user directory. For the most part, this is a super-repo that loads all my application specific configurations.

To-do
-----
*Create an installer that initializes all submodules, running any installer scripts they might have, and creating any required symlinks
*Use generators for any sensitive configuration files so private information is not publicly hosted
