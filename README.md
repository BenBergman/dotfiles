dotfiles

This is a repository for all the configuration files found in my Linux user directory. For the most part, this is a super-repo that loads all my application specific configurations.

To-do
Create an installer that initializes all submodules, running any installer scripts they might have, and creating any required symlinks
Use generators for any sensitive configuration files so private information is not publicly hosted
